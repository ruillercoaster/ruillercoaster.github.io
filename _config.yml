  Hi, my name's Rui (pronounced as "RAE"). I am an assistant professor at the Kravis Department of Integrated Sciences at Claremont McKenna College. My research interest is evaluating global ecosystem-climate feedbacks, such as carbon, water, and energy fluxes between land and atmosphere, using a fusion of remote sensing techniques and process-based modeling, specifically in regions with limited direct measurements, including the Arctic, tropics, and mountainous regions.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF)</mark>, <mark>peatland hydrology</mark>, <mark>land-atmosphere flux sensing</mark>, and <mark>process-based inverse modeling</mark>

  I am maintaining a customizable gridding code for satellite soundings, e.g., gridded TROPOMI SIF (instantaneous, day-length corrected, and relative SIF). Feel free to contact me if you are interested in getting gridded products. 

  Interested students in 7Cs, especially those with research interests in remote sensing, machine learning, and/or process-based modeling, are welcome to contact me for potential research opportunities.
